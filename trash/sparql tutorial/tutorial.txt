Find all the predicates used to establish relationships between the subjects and objects:

  SELECT ?predicate
  WHERE { ?subject ?predicate ?object }

This creates quite a list of predicates, and the list can be significantly shorted if only the duplicates are removed:

  SELECT DISTINCT ?predicate
  WHERE { ?subject ?predicate ?object }

The search results can be made a bit more readable if they are sorted:

  SELECT DISTINCT ?predicate
  WHERE { ?subject ?predicate ?object }
  ORDER BY ?predicate

One of the resulting predicates is "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title" denoting some sort of title relationship, and so all the titles in the collection can be listed in sorted order:

  SELECT ?object
  WHERE { ?subject <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?object }
  ORDER BY ?object

One of the predicates is "http://simile.mit.edu/2006/01/roles#creator" denoting the name of somebody, so all creators can be listed:

  SELECT ?object
  WHERE { ?subject <http://simile.mit.edu/2006/01/roles#creator> ?object }

There are other name-like things in the prediate list -- <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name>, and these can be listed:

  SELECT ?object
  WHERE { ?subject <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> ?object }

There are notes:

  SELECT ?object
  WHERE { ?subject <http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk/def/note> ?object }
  ORDER BY ?object
  


  SELECT ?predicate ?object
  WHERE { <http://infomotions.com/sandbox/liam/id/archivalresource/httphdllocgovlocafceadafcaf011020-3-1-2> ?predicate ?object  }
  ORDER BY ?predicate
