3.a. Ontologies and vocabularies

RDF and linked data is about making relationships between things. These relationships are denoted in the predicates of RDF triples, and the types of relationships are defined in ontologies. These ontologies are sometimes called schema. In the world of bibliography (think "Dublin Core"), these relationship types include things such "has title", "has subject", or "has author". In other ontologies, such as Friend of a Friend (FOAF), there are relationship types such as "has home page", "has email address", or "has name". Obviously there are similarities between things like "has author" and "has name", and consequently there are other ontologies (schemas) allowing equivocation, similarity, or hierarchy to be denoted. 

In the world of archives, collections and their items are described. Think metadata. Some of this metadata comes from name authority lists and controlled vocabulary terms. Many of the authority lists and controlled vocabulary terms used by archives exist as linked data. Thus, when implementing RDF in archives it is expected to state things such as "This particular item was authored by this particular URI", or "This particular collection has a subject of this particular URI" where the URIs are values pointing to items in named authority lists or controlled vocabularies. 

This section lists a set of RDF ontologies and linked data vocabularies of interest to the archivist. It is not necessarily an exhaustive list but instead represents some of the more popular and well-established items:

, and this section enumerates and outlines some of the more useful and interesting ontologies for archival (and cultural heritage institution) description.

Probably one of the more difficult intellectual tasks you will have when it comes to making your content available as linked data will be the selection of one or more ontologies used to make your RDF. Probably the easiest -- but not the most precise -- way to think about ontologies is as if they were fields in a MARC record or an EAD file. Such an analogy is useful, but not 100% correct. Probably the best way to think of the ontologies is as if they were verbs in a sentence denoting relationships between things — subjects and objects. A very interesting read on the subject of ontology selection and archival description are a couple of blog postings from the LOHAC blogs. [1]

See also OWL @ Manchester (http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk) - The University of Manchester has a rich tradition of developing ontology languages, tools, methodologies, and applications. Historically, several lines of research at Manchester contributed directly to the development of OWL as a W3C standard and the School of Computer Science continues to be recognized as an international centre of OWL and OWL related research.


But if ontologies are sets of “verbs”, then they are akin to human language, and human language is ambiguous. Therein lies the difficulty with ontologies. There is no “right” way to implement them. Instead, there is only best or common practice. There are no hard and fast rules. Everything comes with a bit of interpretation. The application and use of ontologies is very much like the application and use of written language in general. In order for written language to work well two equally important things need to happen. First, the writer needs to be able to write. They need to be able to choose the most appropriate language for their intended audience. Shakespeare is not “right” with his descriptions of love, but instead his descriptions of love (and many other human emotions) resinate with a very large number of people. Second, written language requires the reader to have a particular adeptness as well. Shakespeare can not be expected to write one thing and communicate to everybody. The reader needs to understand English, or the translation from English into another language needs to be compete and accurate. 

The Internet, by design, is a decentralized environment. There are very few rules on how it is expected to be used. To a great extent it relies on sets of behavior that are more common practice as opposed to articulated rules. For example, what “rules” exist for tweets on Twitter? What rules exist for Facebook or blog postings. Creating sets of rules will not fly on the Internet because there is no over-arching governing body to enforce any rules.  Sure, there are things like Dublin Core with their definitions, but those definitions are left to interpretation, and there are no judges nor courts nor laws determining whether or not any particular application of Dublin Core is “correct”. Only the common use of Dublin Core is correct, and its use is not set in stone. 

There are no “should’s” on the Internet. There is only common practice. 

With this in mind, it is best for you to work with others both inside and outside your discipline to select one or more ontologies to be used in your linked data. Do not think about this too long nor too hard. It is an never-ending process that is never correct. It is only a process that approximates the best solution. 

 For simplicity's sake, RDF ontologies are akin to the fields in MARC records or the entities in EAD/XML files. Articulated more accurately, they are the things denoting relationships between subjects and objects in RDF triples. In this light, they are akin to the verbs in all but the most simplistic of sentences. But if they are akin to verbs, then they bring with them all of the nuance and subtlety of human written language. And human written language, in order to be an effective human communications device, comes with two equally important prerequisites: 1) a writer who can speak to an intended audience, and 2) a reader with a certain level of intelligence. A writer who does not use the language of the intended audience speaks to few, and a reader who does not "bring something to the party" goes away with little understanding. Because the effectiveness of every writer is not perfect, and because not every reader comes to the party with a certain level of understanding, written language is imperfect. Similarly, the ontologies of linked data are imperfect. There are no perfect ontologies nor absolutely correct uses of them. There are only best practices and common usages.

While some or all of these ontologies may be useful for linked data of archival descriptions, what might some other ontologies include? (Remember, it is often "better" to select existing ontologies rather than inventing, unless there is something distinctly unique about a particular domain.) For example, how about an ontology denoting times? Or how about one for places? FOAF is good for people, but what about organizations or institutions?

This being the case, ontologies still need to be selected in order for linked data to be manifested. What ontologies would you suggest be used when creating linked data for archival descriptions? Here are a few possibilities, listed in no priority order:


Directories of ontologies

  * Linked Open Vocabularies (http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) - This is
	a list of more than 400 RDF ontologies with both a searchable/browsable
	interface. It is als accessible via linked data publishing principles.

  * Open Metadata Registry (http://metadataregistry.net) - This is a list
	of more than 300 RDF ontologies. The Registry was originally conceived
	of as a National Science Foundation project called the National Science
	Foundation Digital Library (NSDL) Registry. The Registry seems heavy on
  sets of controlled vocabularies of a bibliographic nature 

 
Vocabularies

  * Getty Vocabularies (http://vocab.getty.edu) - A set of thesari
	used to "categorize, describe, and index cultural heritage objects and
	information".

  * Library of Congress Linked Data Service (http://id.loc.gov/) - A set
	of data sets used for bibliographic classification: subjects, names,
	genres, formats, etc.

  * New York Times (http://data.nytimes.com/) - A list of New York Times
    subject headings.

  * VIAF (http://viaf.org/) - This data set functions as a name
    authority file. The human-readable interface is quite nice.


Ontologies

  * Archival Collections Ontology (https://github.com/rubinsztajn/archival) - Created by Aaron Rubinstein (University of Massachusetts) is small ontology specifically designed for archival collections.

  * Bibo (http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/) - Just as the name infers, this ontology is intended to model bibliographic citations. 
  
  * Bibframe (http://bibframe.org) - Another ontology which is bibliographic in nature and includes an abundance of properties for various identifiers. 
  
  * CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (http://www.cidoc-crm.org) - Intended for cultural heritage institutions, this model includes quite a number of subclass items surrounding two primary concepts: things and time. 
  
  * Dublin Core Terms (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) - This ontology is rather bibliographic in nature, and provides a framework for describing many of ht of archival descriptions.

  * Europeneana (http://ontogenealogy.com/europeana-data-model-edm/) - Another approach is to the data model from other oganizations. Since Europeneana’s data is intended to be available as linked data, then it might be a good model to explore — http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation  Specifically: For the archival community, collection level descriptions such as EAD play a major role.They fit neatly under the EDM,in particular the notion of ore:aggregration allows for describing archival “fonds”. The International Council of Archives just started the discussion about a common conceptual model similar to FRBR or the CRM. In the meanwhile, with the CRM historical facts associated with archival contents can be described in more detail than just on the EDM level (Stasinopoulou et. al. 2007). Further, collection-level descriptions in Dublin Core are quite convenient and becoming popular for archival descriptions. — 

  * FOAF (http://www.foaf-project.org/) - Friend Of A Friend (FOAF) is a popular and often-quoted ontology for modeling people and the social networks they create: names, email address, social network account identifiers, etc. 

  * LOCAH RDF Vocabulary (http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk/def/) - This is the model designed for the LOCAH Project from the Archives Hub in the United Kingdom. It is the model underpinning the transformed EAD files of the LiAM "sandbox". 

  * MARC21 Vocabularies from Metadata Management Associates (http://marc21rdf.info) - 

  * OAD Vocabulary - (http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/oadNew.html) - "[Google translation] The definition of an ontology of archival description is needed in order to test the potential of the web of data to archival descriptions. The archival description aims at the representation of a unit of description by collecting, analyzing, organizing and recording the information needed to identify, manage, locate and explain the context and documentary material and the storage systems that produced (ISAD (G)). The ontology of archival description (SRO) has as its goal the formal representation of the descriptions of the individual units of description - understood as objects of their archival descriptions. In particular, the SRO waiver to take into account all the individual elements of these descriptions, in endless variations they present as part of the archival systems in which they are hinged, but instead seeks only to explain the elements of information deemed necessary for the exposure the web of data units of archival description to ensure integration with other datasets published also in format Linked Open Data. SROs, in beta, is expressed in OWL (Ontology Web Language): it takes into account all the elements of archival description in the standard ISAD (G): general international standard archival description, adopted by the ICA (International Council on Archives) integrating them with other information elements not covered by the standard mentioned - as the index entries - and with links to creators and conservative. The formal mechanisms provided by the standard RDF and OWL have made it possible to bring the information elements of archival descriptions expressed in an ontology SROs to "external" concepts representative of traditional archival descriptive and based on the international standard ISAD (G). Since the experiments conducted by the partners of the project ReLoad had as object data encoded on the basis of the framework EAD (Encoded Archival Description), the ontology provides for a specific class OAD "eadElement" designed to encode the information on the element or attribute of the EAD scheme used by the organization that provides data archival description, which is also attributed to the ISAD (G) on the basis of official mapping ISAD (G) - EAD 

  * OWL (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL) - 
  
  * PROV (http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) - for provenance information.

  * RDF - This ontology is necessary because linked data is manifested as... RDF

  * RDFS (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) - This ontology may be necessary because the archival community may be creating some of its own ontologies.

  * Schema.org (http://schema.org) - Originally sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc. this ontology is advocated by the major Internet search engines. It is a growing, well-supported ontology, and it is seemingly designed for just about anything under the sun.
  
  * SKOS (http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) - This ontology is used to create thesauri. 

  * VoID (http://semanticweb.org/wiki/VoID) - This relatively simple data model is used to describe RDF data sets with things like their location, size, licensing terms, frequency of updates, etc.
