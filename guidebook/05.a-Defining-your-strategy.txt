5.a. Defining your strategy: Articulate goals, objectives, and metrics to measure success.

The building blocks of linked data include:

  * URIs pointing to real-world objects: people, places, or things where things can be ideas or just about anything on the Web 
  * Ontologies, the language(s) of relationships between the URIs 
  * Content to share with the wider world 
  * People to do the work 
  * Computer technology to manifest the work


With this in mind, articulate some goals — broad targets of things you would like to accomplish. Some of them might include:

  * making your archival collections more widely accessible
  * working with others to build virtual collections of like topics or formats
  * incorporating your archival descriptions into public spaces like Wikipedia
  * integrating your collections into local teaching, learning, and research activities
  * increasing the awareness of your archive to benefactors
  * increasing the computer technology skills of fellow archivists

How might you go about accomplishing these goals? What are your objectives? (What method of transportation are you going to use to get where you are going?) How am I going to measure success? In other words, you will need to create an plan, and each item in the plan answers a simple question — Who is going to do what by when? In other word, what people will be responsible for accomplishing the particular objective. Exactly what will they be doing, and by what time will they have it accomplished. Each of these components are described in greater detail below

Who

It is quite unlikely your linked data goals and objectives will be accomplished by a single person. Instead it will most likely required a team of people. These people do not necessarily need to working in the same physical location, but they will require a diverse set of skills. Some of them include, and each plays a key, indispensable role:

  * content specialists - These are the people who understand the “aboutness” of a particular collection. These are the people who understand and can thoroughly articulate the significance of a collection. They know how and why particular things belong in a collection. They are able to answer questions about the collection as all as tell stories against it. 

  * metadata specialists - These are people who understand data about data. Not only do they understand the principles of controlled vocabularies and authority lists, but they are also familiar with a wide variety of such lists, specifically as they are represented on the Web. In linked data there are fewer descriptive cataloging “rules”. Nevertheless, the way the ontologies of linked data can be used need to be interpreted, and this interpretation needs to be consistent. Metadata specialists understand these principles.

  * computer technologists - Not only are these the people who have a fundamental understanding of what computer can and cannot do, but they also know how to put this understanding into practice. At the very least, the computer technologists need to understand a myriad of data structures and how to convert them into different data structures. Converting MARC 21 into MARCXML. Transforming EAD into HTML. Reporting against a relational database to create serialized RDF. These tasks required computer programming skills, but not necessarily any one in particular. Any modern programming language (Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.) includes the necessary function to complete the tasks. 

What

The what of your objectives are not so much identified with nouns as they are action verbs, such as: write, evaluate, implement, examine, purchase, hire, prioritize, list, delete, acquire, discuss, share, find, compare & contrast, stop, start, complete, continue, describe, edit, updated, create, purchase, upgrade, etc. The what of your objective is in the doing.

When

The say, “Work expands to fill the available space.” If this is true, and no deadlines are articulated for each objective, then the allotted amount of time for any given task is all but infinite, but this it not true. Time is one of the most limited resources you have. When thinking about a given objective, ask yourself how much time you think it will take, multiply the time by one and a half. Ask yourself when the task can begin and document the beginning point as well as the estimated ending point. Do this all of your objectives and the result will be a Gantt chart. It will now be easy to look at the chart on a regular basis to see who things are progressing.
