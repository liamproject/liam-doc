4.b. Trends in LOD-LAM

  * Mash ups
  * Harvesting along side other protocols
  * Increased interest
  * Increased number of RDF serializations
  * Governments making their content available
  * Using them to enhance online catalogs
  * Creating timelines
  * Creating “named graphs”
  * Increased number of programming toolkits
  * Emphasis on “open” linked data and linked data in museums and archives
  * Making RDF dumps available
  * Interest in schema.org

With great interest I read the Spring/Summer issue of Information Standards Quarterly where there were a number of articles pertaining to linked open data in cultural heritage institutions. [0] Of particular interest to me where the various loosely enumerated challenges of linked open data. Some of them included:

  * the apparent Tower Of Babel when it comes to vocabularies used to describe content, and the same time we need to have “ontology mindfulness”. 
  * dirty, inconsistent, or wide varieties of data integrity
  * persistent URIs
  * the “chicken & egg” problem of why linked data if there is no killer application
