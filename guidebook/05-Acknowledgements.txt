The creation of this guidebook is really the effort of many people, not a single author. First and foremost, thanks goes to Anne Sauer and Eliot Wilczek. Anne saw the need, spearheaded the project, and made it a reality. Working side-by-side was Eliot who saw the guidebook to fruition. Then there is the team of people from the Working Group: Greg Colati, Karen Gracy, Corey Harper, Michelle Light, Susan Pyzynski, Aaron Rubinstein, Ed Summers, Kenneth Thibodeau, and Kathy Wisser. These people made themselves available for discussion and clarification. They provided balance between human archival practice and seemingly cold computer technology. Additional people offered their advice into the issues of linked data in archives including: Kevin Cawley, Diane Hillman, Mark Matienzo, Ross Singer, and Jane & Ade Stevenson. They filled in many gaps. Special thanks goes to my boss Tracey Bergstrom who more than graciously enabled some of this work to happen on company time. The questions raised by the anonymized library school student are definitely appreciated. The Code4Lib community was very helpful -- a sort of reality check. And then there are the countless other people who listened over and over again about what linked data is, is not, and what it can do. A big "thank you" goes to all.
