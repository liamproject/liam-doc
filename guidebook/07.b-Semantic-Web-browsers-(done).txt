7.b. Semantic Web browsers (done)

This is a small set of Semantic Web browsers. Give them URIs and they allow you to follow and describe the links they include.

  * Inspector (http://inspector.sindice.com) - Creates graphs,
    lists ontologies, generates a full-text report from literals, and
    lists triples found at the other end of URIs.

  * LinkSailor (http://linksailor.com) - Feed this interface a
    URI that points to many other actionable URIs, and it will
    return an interesting mash-up including images, paragraphs of
    texts, and hyperlinks to more content.
  
  * LOD Browser Switch (http://browse.semanticweb.org) - This is
    really a gateway to other Semantic Web browsers. Feed it a URI
    and it will create lists of URLs pointing to Semantic Web
    interfaces, but many of the URLs (Semantic Web interfaces) do not
    seem to work. Some of the resulting URLs point to RDF\
    serialization converters

  * LodLive (http://en.lodlive.it) - This Semantic Web browser
    allows you to feed it a URI and interactively follow the links
    associated with it. URIs can come from DBedia, Freebase, or one
    of your own.

  * Open Link Data Explorer
    (http://demo.openlinksw.com/rdfbrowser2/) - The most
    sophisticated Semantic Web browser in this set. Given a URI it
    creates various views of the resulting triples associated with
    including lists of all its properties and objects, networks
    graphs, tabular views, and maps (if the data includes geographic
    points).

  * Quick and Dirty RDF browser
    (http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/browser/) - Given the URL
    pointing to a file of RDF statements, this tool returns all the
    triples in the file and verbosely lists each of their predicate
    and object values. Quick and easy.  This is a good for reading
    everything about a particular resource. The tool does not seem
    to support content negotiation.

If you need some URIs to begin with, then try some of these:

  * Ray Family Papers - http://infomotions.com/sandbox/liam/data/mum432.rdf
  * Catholics and Jews - http://infomotions.com/sandbox/liam/data/shumarc681792.rdf
  * Walt Disney via VIAF - http://viaf.org/viaf/36927108/
  * origami via the Library of Congress - http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85095643
  * Paris from DBpedia - http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris
