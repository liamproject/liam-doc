4.a. Projects: Brief descriptions with an emphasis on tangible benefits and outcomes of each (done)

While the number of linked data websites is less than the worldwide total number, it is really not possible to list every linked data project but only things that will presently useful to the archivist and computer technologist working in cultural heritage institutions. And even then the list of sites will not be complete. Instead, listed below are a number of websites of interest today.

The list is divided into two parts: introductions, data sets and projects. The introductions are akin to directories or initial guilds filled with pointers to information about RDF especially meaningful to archivists (and other cultural heritage workers). The data sets and projects range from simple RDF dumps to full-blown discovery systems. In between some simple browsable lists and raw SPARQL endpoints.


Introductions

  * Datahub (http://datahub.io/) - This is a directory of data sets. It
	includes descriptions of hundreds of data collections. Some of them are
	linked data sets. Some of them are not.

  * LODLAM (http://lodlam.net/) - LODLAM is an acronym for Linked Open
	Data in Libraries Archives and Museums. LODLAM.net is a community, both
	virtual and real, of linked data aficionados in cultural heritage
	institutions. It, like OpenGLAM, is a good place to discuss linked data
	in general.

  * OpenGLAM http://openglam.org) - GLAM is an acronym for Galleries,
	Libraries, Archives, and Museums. OpenGLAM is a community fostered by
	the Open Knowledge Foundation and a place to to discuss linked data that
	is "free". for It, like LODLAM, is a good place to discuss linked data
	in general.

  * semanticweb.org (http://semanticweb.org) - semanticweb.org is a portal
	for publishing information on research and development related to the
	topics Semantic Web and Wikis. Includes data.semanticweb.org and
	data.semanticweb.org/snorql.


Data sets and projects

  * 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) - This is an
	archive of digitized newspaper articles which is made accessible not
	only as HTML but a number of other metadata formats such as RDFa,
	METS/MODS and OAI-ORE. It is a good example of how metadata publishing
	can be mixed and matched in a single publishing system.

  * AGRIS (http://agris.fao.org/openagris/) - Here you will find a very
	large collection of bibliographic information from the field of
	agriculture. It is accessible via quite a number of methods including
    linked data.

  * D2R Server for the CIA Factbook
	(http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/factbook/) - The content
	of the World Fact Book distributed as linked data.

  * D2R Server for the Gutenberg Project
	(http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/gutendata/) - This is a
	data set of Project Gutenburgh content -- a list of digitized public
	domain works, mostly books.

  * Dbpedia (http://dbpedia.org/About) - In the simplest terms, this is
	the content of Wikipedia made accessible as RDF.

  * [FindAndConnect (http://www.findandconnect.gov.au) - 

  * LIBRIS (http://libris.kb.se) - This is the joint catalog of the
	Swedish academic and research libraries. Search results are presented
	in HTML, but the URLs pointing to individual items are really
	actionable URIs resolvable via content negotiation, thus support
	distribution of bibliographic information as RDF. This initiative is
	very similar to OpenCat.

  * Linked Archives Hub Test Dataset (http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk) -
	This data set is RDF generated from a selection of archival finding
	aids harvested by the Archives Hub in the United Kingdom.

  * Linked Movie Data Base (http://linkedmdb.org/) - A data set of movie
    information.

  * Linked Open Data at Europeana (http://pro.europeana.eu/datasets) - A
	growing set of RDF generated from the descriptions of content in
	Europeana.

  * Linking Lives (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/linkinglives/) - While this
	project has had no working interface, it is a good read on the
	challenges of presenting link data people (as opposed to computers).
	Its blog site enumerates and discusses issues from provenance to
	unique identifiers, from data clean up to interface design.

  * LOCAH Project (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/locah/) - This is/was a
	joint project between Mimas and UKOLN to make Archives Hub data
	available as structured Linked Data. (All three organizations are
	located in the United Kingdom.). EAD files were aggregated. Using
	XSLT, they were transformed into RDF/XML, and the RDF/XML was saved in
	a triple store. The triple store was then dumped as a file as well as
	made searchable via a SPARQL endpoint.

  * OCLC Data Sets & Services (http://www.oclc.org/data/) - Here you
	will find a number of freely available bibliographic data sets and
	services. Some are available as RDF and linked data. Others are Web
	services.

  * OpenCat (http://demo.cubicweb.org/opencatfresnes/) - This is a
	library catalog combining the authority data (available as RDF)
	provided by the National Library of France with works of a second
	library (Fresnes Public Library). Item level search results have URIs
	whose RDF is available via content negotiation. This project is
	similar to LIBRIS.

  * PELAGIOS
	(http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/p/about-pelagios.html) - A data
	set of ancient places.

  * ReLoad (http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/en) - This is a
	collaboration between the Central State Archive of Italy, the Cultural
	Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region, and Regesta.exe. It is
	the aggregation of EAD files from a number of archives which have been
	transformed into RDF and made available as linked data. Its purpose
	and intent are very similar to the the purpose and intent of the
	combined LOCAH Project and Linking Lives.

  * SNAC (http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu) - 
  
  * World Bank Linked Data (http://worldbank.270a.info/.html) - A data
	set of World Bank indicators, climate change information, finances,
	etc.
