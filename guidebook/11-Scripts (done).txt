This section lists a set of computer source code implementing a simple linked data publishing system. Assuming the (Perl) developer has on hand a set of EAD finding aids and/or sets of MARC records, this system can:

  * transform EAD into RDF/XML
  * transform EAD into HTML
  * convert MARC into RDF/XML
  * convert MARC into HTML
  * support content negotiation against the RDF/XML and HTML
  * initialize a triple store
  * batch load RDF/XML into the triple store
  * search the triple store
  * dump the entire triple store as RDF/XML
  * support a SPARQL endpoint against the triple store

This publishing system is more than a toy and ought to be able to support the needs of many archives with small- to medium-sized collections.
