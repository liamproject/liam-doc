About the author

Eric Lease Morgan is a Digital Initiatives Librarian as the University of Notre Dame. He considers himself to be a librarian first and a computer user second. His professional goal is to discover new ways to use computers to provide better library services. An advocate of open source software and open access publishing, he has been freely giving this intellectual property aways since before the phrases were coined. This Guidebook is the fourth book-length thing he has written. Others included: 1) WAIS and Gopher Servers: A Guide for Internet End-Users, 2) Pointers 4 Searching, Searching 4 Pointers, and 3) Open Source Software in Libraries. He has written and presented consistently throughout his career, and just about all of his writings can be found online at one of two places:

  1. Musings on Information and Librarianship
	 (http://infomotions.com/musings/) - pretty much all of Eric's
	 published work from the beginning of his career until 2010

  2. Planet Eric Lease Morgan (http://planet.infomotions.com) - an
	 aggregation of all his postings from as many as five different
	 blogs

Eric also exhibits his paints, plays guitar, grows roses, likes to row in his boat, and binds his own handmade books.
