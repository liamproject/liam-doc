5.e. What you can do now if you have (done)

Each of the sections below outline how you can participate in linked data if currently have any number of metadata file formats (MARC, EAD, etc.).

Please remember, RDF is really about sets of triples, and these sets do not neatly correspond to document structures like MARC or EAD. Using MARC and/or EAD to publish linked data is functional but not necessarily optimal. At the same time, there does not currently exist a method for people writing archival description to directly publish the fruits of their labors as RDF. Until such methods present themselves, transforming present dauy metadata file formats is a viable option.
