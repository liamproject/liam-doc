5. Getting Started: Strategies and Steps


Linked data represents a modern way of making your archival descriptions accessible to the wider world. In that light, it represents a different way of doing things but not necessary a different what of doing things. You will still be doing inventory. You will still be curating collections. You will still be prioritizing what goes and what stays.

On the other hand, linked data changes the way your descriptions get expressed and distributed. It is a lot like taking a trip across country. The goal was always to get to the coast to see the ocean, but instead of walking, going by stage coach, taking a train, or driving a car, you will be flying. Along the way you may visit a few cities and have a few layovers. Bad weather may even get in the way, but sooner or later you will get to your destination. Take a deep breath. Understand that the process will be one of learning, and that learning will be applicable in other aspects of your work. The result will be two-fold. First, a greater number of people will have access to your collections, and consequently, more people will will be using your collections.
