7.a.ii. Gaps: What is needed

There needs to be easy to use tools to find URIs and insert them in to archival descriptions. One such tool is called lobid:

  In “From strings to things: A linked data API for library hackers
  and Web developers” Fabian Steeg and Pascal Christoph (HBZ)
  described an interface allowing librarians to determine the URIs
  of people, places, and things for library catalog records. “How
  can we benefit from linked data without being linked data
  experts? We want to pub Web developers into focus using JSON for
  HTTP.” There are few hacks illustrating some of their work on
  Github in the lobid repository. --https://github.com/lobid

Another example would be an interface to the varius linked data sets available from the Library of Congress. --http://id.loc.gov

Listed in no priority order, some of the things needed, include:

  * hands-on training
  * desktop tools enabling people or machines to associate strings with URIs
  * a simple RDF statement editor
  * the killer app / additional demonstration applications
  * a conceptional shift from document to statement

A "real" RDF editing tool is a gap. 

A [insert your favorite tool here, such as Archivist's Toolkit, Archon, ArchiveSpace, etc.] to RDF publishing system tool to a gap.
