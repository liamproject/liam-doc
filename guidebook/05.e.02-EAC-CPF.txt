5.e.ii. EAC-CPF

Encoded Archival Context for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF) goes a long way to implementing a named authority database that could be linked from archival descriptions. These XML files could easily be transformed into serialized RDF and therefore linked data. The resulting URIs could then be incorporated into archival descriptions making the descriptions richer and more complete.

For example the FindAndConnect site in Australia uses EAC-CPF under the hood to disseminate information about people in its collection. [1] Similarly, “SNAC aims to not only make the [EAC-CPF] records more easily discovered and accessed but also, and at the same time, build an unprecedented resource that provides access to the socio-historical contexts (which includes people, families, and corporate bodies) in which the records were created” -- u  More than a thousand EAC-CPF records are available from the RAMP project -- http://demo.rampeditor.info/export.php
