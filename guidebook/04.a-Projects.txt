4.a. Projects: Brief descriptions with an emphasis on tangible benefits and outcomes of each

While the number of linked data websites is less than the worldwide total number, it is really not possible to list every linked data project but only things that will presently useful to the archivist and computer technologist working in cultural heritage institutions. And even then the list of sites will not be complete. Instead, listed below are a number of websites of interest today.

The list is divided into three parts: introductions, data sets, and "projects". The introductions are are akin to directories or initial guilds. The data sets are collections of RDF available for harvesting. The projects have used content in data sets to provide value-added information services. 


Introductions

  * Datahub (http://datahub.io/) - This is a directory of data sets. It includes descriptions of hundreds of data collections. Some of them are linked data sets. Some of them are not. 
  
  * LODLAM (http://lodlam.net/) - LODLAM is an acronym for Linked Open Data in Libraries Archives and Museums. LODLAM.net is community, both virtual and real, of linked data aficionados in cultural heritage institutions. It, like OpenGLAM, is a good place to discuss linked data in general.
  
  * OpenGLAM http://openglam.org) - GLAM is an acronym for Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums. OpenGLAM is a community fostered by the Open Knowledge Foundation and a place to to discuss linked data that is "free". for It, like LODLAM, is a good place to discuss linked data in general.

  * Datahub (http://datahub.io/) - the free, powerful data management platform from the Open Knowledge Foundation


Data sets

  * D2R Server for the CIA Factbook (http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/factbook/) - The content of the World Fact Book distributed as linked data.

  * D2R Server for the Gutenberg Project (http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/gutendata/) - This is a data set of Project Gutenburgh content -- a list of digitized public domain works, mostly books.
  
  * Getty Vocabularies (http://vocab.getty.edu) - A set of data sets used to "categorize, describe, and index cultural heritage objects and information". 
   
  * Library of Congress Linked Data Service (http://id.loc.gov/) - A set of data sets used for bibliographic classification: subjects, names, genres, formats, etc.
  
  * Linked Archives Hub Test Dataset (http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk) - The data set is RDF generated from a selection of archival finding aids harvested by the Archives Hub in the United Kingdom.

  * Linked Movie Data Base (http://linkedmdb.org/) - A data set of movie information.
  
  * Linked Open Data at Europeana (http://pro.europeana.eu/datasets) - A growing set of RDF generated from the descriptions of content in Europeana. 
  
  * Linked Open Vocabularies (http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) - A linked data set of linked data sets.
  
  * New York Times (http://data.nytimes.com/) - A list of New York Times subject headings.
  
  * OCLC Data Sets & Services (http://www.oclc.org/data/) - Here you will find a number of freely available bibliographic data sets and services. Some are available as RDF and linked data. Others are Web services. 

  * PELAGIOS (http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/p/about-pelagios.html) - A data set of ancient places.
  
  * VIAF (http://viaf.org/) - This data set functions as a name authority file.
  
  * Wiki.dbpedia.org (http://dbpedia.org/About) - In the simplest terms, this is the content of Wikipedia made accessible as RDF. 
  
  * World Bank Linked Data (http://worldbank.270a.info/.html) - A data set of World Bank indicators, climate change information, finances, etc. 


Projects

  * 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) - "I’ve (Neubert Joachim <J.Neubert@zbw.eu>) published the persons and company part of the 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) as a linked data application. It uses RDFa and OAI-ORE extensively to give every dossier, every article and every page a citable URI, and on the other hand consumes linked data from various linked data sources to enrich the web pages and to provide context to the rather plain scanned article images. See http://challenge.semanticweb.org/submissions/swc2010_submission_6.pdf for more detail."

  * Linking Lives (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/linkinglives/) - Linking Lives is exploring ways to present Linked Data. We aim to show that archives can benefit from being presented as a part of the diverse data sources on the Web to create full biographical pictures, enabling researchers to make connections between people and events. Linking Lives builds upon the Locah project. Locah was a JISC-funded project to expose the Archives Hub descriptions as Linked Data.

  * LOCAH Project (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/locah/) - Mimas and UKOLN worked together on an exciting JISC funded project to make Archives Hub data available as structured Linked Data, for the benefit of education and research. We worked in partnership with Eduserv, Talis and OCLC, leading experts within their fields. The aim was put archival and bibliographic data at the heart of the Linked Data Web, enabling new links to be made between diverse content sources and enabling the free and flexible exploration of data so that researchers can make new connections between subjects, people, organisations and places to reveal more about our history and society.

  * OpenCat (http://demo.cubicweb.org/opencatfresnes/) - Another common theme / application demonstrated at the conference were variations of the venerable library catalog. OpenCat, presented by Agnes Simon (Bibliothéque Nationale de France), was an additional example of this trend. Combining authority data (available as RDF) provided by the National Library of France with works of a second library (Fresnes Public Library), the OpenCat prototype provides quite an interesting interface to library holdings.

  * ReLoad (http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/en) - an Italian experimentation started in 2012 and supported by Central State Archive, Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region and regesta.exe, published the first version of OAD ontology (ontology for archival description) based on ISAD (G) standard and EAD schema, in 2013. The project team define a specific ontology for archival description domain because there isn't yet something useful to describe all significant classes and properties necessary in archival description and we integrated OAD with other "Lightweight ontologies" (like foaf or dublin core) to encode the most common metadata. Within Reload project, to describe authority records in Linked Data we use EAC-CPF ontology, published in 2012 by Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region. From the website: "The ReLoad project (Repository for Linked open archival data) will foster experimentation with the technology and methods of linked open data for archival resources. Its goal is the creation of a web of linked archival data."
