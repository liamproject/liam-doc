7. Tools and Visualizations

This section lists various tools for archivists and computer technologists wanting to participate in various aspects of linked data. Here you will find pointers to creating, editing, storing, publishing, and searching linked data. 


Directories

The sites listed in this section enumerate linked data and RDF tools. They are jumping off places to other sites:

  * ConverterToRdf (http://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf) - Hosted by the
	W3C this is a long list links pointing to applications that will convert
	varius forms of data into RDF. The list is long, and defunct tools may
	not be updated as such.

  * Linked Data Tools (http://linkeddata.org/tools) - Linkeddata.org is
	the home of the famous linked data "cloud" image, and LinkedData.org
	also includes a number of directory-like pages on linked data in
	general. One of those pages is a list of linked data tools.

  * SemWebClients
	(http://www.w3.org/wiki/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/
	SemWebClients) - Hosted by the W3C, this is a list of Semantic Web
	clients and applications.

  * RDFImportersAndAdapters
	(http://www.w3.org/wiki/RDFImportersAndAdapters) - A list of tools and
	applications for converting various data and file formats into
	serialized RDF.

  * SIMILE RDFizers (http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/RDFizers) - Another list
    of tools for converting data and files into RDF.

  * SparqlImplementations (http://www.w3.org/wiki/SparqlImplementations) -
    Another page hosted by the W3C, and listing SPARQL clients and tools.

  * Tools (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Tools) - Hosted by the W3C, this
	page is a sort of directory of directories for all sort of linked data
	and RDF tools: editors, converters, SPARQL clients, triple stores, etc.


RDF converters, validators, etc.

  * ead2rdf (http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk/xslt/ead2rdf.xsl) - This is the
	XST stylesheet previously used by the Archives Hub in their LOCAH Linked
	Archives Hub project. It transforms EAD files into RDF/XML. A slightly
	modified version of this stylesheet was used to create the LiAM
	"sandbox".

  * Protégé (http://protege.stanford.edu) - Install this well-respected
	tool locally or use it as a hosted Web application to create OWL
	ontologies.

  * RAMP (http://www.rampeditor.info/) - "The Remixing Archival
	Metadata Project (RAMP) is a lightweight web-based editing tool
	that is intended to let users do two things: (1) generate
	enhanced authority records for creators of archival collections
	and (2) publish the content of those records as Wikipedia pages."
  
  * RDF2RDF (http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/) - A handy Java jar file
	enabling you to convert various versions of serialized RDF into other
	versions of serialized RDF.

  * Vapour, a Linked Data Validator
	(http://validator.linkeddata.org/vapour) - Much like the W3C validator,
	this online tool will validate the RDF at the other end of a URI. Unlike
	the W3C validator, it echoes back and forth the results of the content
	negotiation process.

  * W3C RDF Validation Service (http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/) - Enter
	a URI or paste an RDF/XML document into the text field, and a triple
	representation of the corresponding data model as well as an optional
	graphical visualization of the data model will be displayed.
  

Linked data frameworks and publishing systems

  * 4store (http://4store.org/) - A linked data publishing framework for
	managing triple stores, querying them locally, querying them via SPARQL,
	dumping their contents to files, as well as providing support via a
	number of scripting languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, etc.).

  * Apache Jena (http://jena.apache.org/) - This is a set of tools for
	creating, maintaining, and publishing linked data complete a SPARQL
	engine, a flexible triple store application, and inference engine.

  * D2RQ (http://d2rq.org/) - Use this application to provide a linked
	data front-end to any (well-designed) relational database. It supports
	SPARQL, content negotiation, and RDF dumps for direct HTTP access or
	uploading into triple store.

  * oai2lod (https://github.com/behas/oai2lod) - This is a particular
	implementation D2RQ Server. More specifically, this tool is an
	intermediary between a OAI-PMH data providers and a linked data
	publishing system. Configure oai2lod to point to your OAI-PMH server and
	it will publish the server's metadata as linked data.

  * OpenLink Virtuoso Open-Source Edition
	(https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/) - An open source
	version of OpenLink Virtuoso. Feature-rich and well-documented.

  * OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server (http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com) -
	This is a commercial version of OpenLink Virtuoso Open-Source Edition.
	It seems to be a platform for modeling and accessing data in a wide
	variety of forms: relational databases, RDF triples stores, etc. Again,
	feature-rich and well-documented.

  * openRDF Sesame (http://www.openrdf.org/) - This is a Java-based framework for
	implementing linked data publishing including the establishment of a
	triple store and a SPARQL endpoint. 

  * OWLIM (https://www.ontotext.com/owlim) - 
  
  * R2RML (http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) - 
  
  
Semantic Web browsers

This is a small set of Semantic Web browsers. Give them URIs and they allow you to follow and describe the links they include.

  * Inspector (http://inspector.sindice.com) - Creates graphs,
    lists ontologies, generates a full-text report from literals, and
    lists triples found at the other end of URIs.

  * LinkSailor (http://linksailor.com) - Feed this interface a
    URI that points to many other actionable URIs, and it will
    return an interesting mash-up including images, paragraphs of
    texts, and hyperlinks to more content.
  
  * LOD Browser Switch (http://browse.semanticweb.org) - This is
    really a gateway to other Semantic Web browsers. Feed it a URI
    and it will create lists of URLs pointing to Semantic Web
    interfaces, but many of the URLs (Semantic Web interfaces) do not
    seem to work. Some of the resulting URLs point to RDF\
    serialization converters

  * LodLive (http://en.lodlive.it) - This Semantic Web browser
    allows you to feed it a URI and interactively follow the links
    associated with it. URIs can come from DBedia, Freebase, or one
    of your own.

  * Open Link Data Explorer
    (http://demo.openlinksw.com/rdfbrowser2/) - The most
    sophisticated Semantic Web browser in this set. Given a URI it
    creates various views of the resulting triples associated with
    including lists of all its properties and objects, networks
    graphs, tabular views, and maps (if the data includes geographic
    points).

  * Quick and Dirty RDF browser
    (http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/browser/) - Given the URL
    pointing to a file of RDF statements, this tool returns all the
    triples in the file and verbosely lists each of their predicate
    and object values. Quick and easy.  This is a good for reading
    everything about a particular resource. The tool does not seem
    to support content negotiation.

If you need some URIs to begin with, then try some of these:

  * Ray Family Papers - http://infomotions.com/sandbox/liam/data/mum432.rdf
  * Catholics and Jews - http://infomotions.com/sandbox/liam/data/shumarc681792.rdf
  * Walt Disney via VIAF - http://viaf.org/viaf/36927108/
  * origami via the Library of Congress - http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85095643
  * Paris from DBpedia - http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris
