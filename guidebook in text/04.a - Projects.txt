4.a. Projects: Brief descriptions with an emphasis on tangible benefits and outcomes of each

ReLoad

The ReLoad project (Repository for Linked open archival data)
will foster experimentation with the technology and methods of
linked open data for archival resources. Its goal is the creation
of a web of linked archival data.

LOD-LAM, which is an acronym for Linked Open Data for Libraries,
Archives and Museums, is an umbrella term for the community and
active projects in this area.

The first experimental phase will make use of W3C semantic web
standards, mash-up techniques, software for linking and for
defining the semantics of the data in the selected databases.

The archives that have made portions of their institutions’ data
and databases openly available for this project are the Central
State Archive, and the Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia
Romagna Region. These will be used to test methodologies to
expose the resources as linked open data.

OAD Vocabulary Specification 1.2 - http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/oadNew.html

Reload project (http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/), an Italian experimentation started in 2012 and supported by Central State Archive, Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region and regesta.exe, published the first version of OAD ontology (ontology for archival description) based on ISAD (G) standard and EAD schema, in 2013. The project team define a specific ontology for archival description domain because there isn't yet something useful to describe all significant classes and properties necessary in archival description and we integrated OAD with other "Lightweight ontologies" (like foaf or dublin core) to encode the most common metadata. Within Reload project, to describe authority records in Linked Data we use EAC-CPF ontology, published in 2012 by Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region.

Reload project was presented during the last LODLAM Challenge in Montréal (http://summit2013.lodlam.net/2012/12/21/announcing-heat-1-lodlam-challenge-finalists/).

You are welcome in any integration and suggestion you'd like to do in this work.

OpenCat

  Another common theme / application demonstrated at the conference
  were variations of the venerable library catalog. OpenCat,
  presented by Agnes Simon (Bibliothéque Nationale de France), was
  an additional example of this trend. Combining authority data
  (available as RDF) provided by the National Library of France
  with works of a second library (Fresnes Public Library), the
  OpenCat prototype provides quite an interesting interface to
  library holdings. --http://demo.cubicweb.org/opencatfresnes/

Newspaper Clippings Archives

  Thank you for your report on SWIB13! I’m glad you enjoyed the
  conference and your stay in Hamburg.

  I wanted to get in touch with you because you mentioned in your
  blog that you are working on a book about LOD in archives.
  Perhaps, in your research for that, you came across
  press/newspaper clippings archives.

  As you may know, I’ve published the persons and company part of
  the 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) as a
  linked data application. It uses RDFa and OAI-ORE extensively to
  give every dossier, every article and every page a citable URI,
  and on the other hand consumes linked data from various linked
  data sources to enrich the web pages and to provide context to
  the rather plain scanned article images.

  I wonder if there are other archives, and particular newspaper
  archives, out there which do similar things, and would be very
  happy about hints.

LOCAH Project

  Mimas and UKOLN worked together on an exciting JISC funded
  project to make Archives Hub data available as structured Linked
  Data, for the benefit of education and research. We worked in
  partnership with Eduserv, Talis and OCLC, leading experts within
  their fields. The aim was put archival and bibliographic data at
  the heart of the Linked Data Web, enabling new links to be made
  between diverse content sources and enabling the free and
  flexible exploration of data so that researchers can make new
  connections between subjects, people, organisations and places to
  reveal more about our history and society. --http://archiveshub.ac.uk/locah/

Linking Lives

  Linking Lives is exploring ways to present Linked Data. We aim to
  show that archives can benefit from being presented as a part of
  the diverse data sources on the Web to create full biographical
  pictures, enabling researchers to make connections between people
  and events.

  Linking Lives builds upon the Locah project. Locah was a
  JISC-funded project to expose the Archives Hub descriptions as
  Linked Data. --http://archiveshub.ac.uk/linkinglives/

Linked Archives Hub Test Dataset

  The dataset describes archives held by UK institutions. The data
  is derived from a sample of the archival finding aids held by the
  UK Archives Hub. --http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk
