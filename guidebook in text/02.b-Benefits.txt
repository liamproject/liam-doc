2.a Benefits

Linked data makes the content of archival collections more accessible and open doors for new types of service.

Archives are about collecting, organizing, preserving, and disseminating original, unique, and primary literature. These are the whats of archival practice, but the hows of archival practice evolve with the changing technology. With the advent of ubiquitous networked computing, people’s expectations regarding access to information and knowledge have changed significantly. Unless institutions like archives change with the times, then the needs previously filled by archives will be filled by other institutions. Linked data is a how of archival practice, and it is one of those changes behooving archives to adopt. It is a standards-based technique for making data and information available on the Web. It is rooted in the very fabric of the Web and therefore is not beholden to any particular constituency. It is a long lasting standard and practice that will last as long as the hypertext transfer protocol is operational.

Making archival descriptions and collection available via linked data will increase the use of those descriptions and collections. It is a form of benign advertising. Commercial search engines will harvest the linked data content and make it available it their search engines. Search engines will return hits to your descriptions and collections driving traffic to you and your site. Digital humanists will harvest your content, perform analysis against it, and create new knowledge or bring hidden knowledge to light. Computer scientist will collect your data, amalgamate it with the data of others, and discover relationship previously unconceived.

You can divide your combined collections and services into two tangible parts: 1) the collections  themselves, and 2) the metadata describing them. It is usually possible to digitize your collections, but the result is rarely 100% satisfactory. Digitization is almost always a useful surrogate not a complete replacement. In this way, your collections as physical objects will always be a draw to all types of learners and researchers. The metadata, on the other hand, is 100% digitizable, and therefore lends itself very well to dissemination on the Internet. Linked data represents one way to make this happen. 

Few archival collections are 100% complete. There are always pieces missing, and some of those missing pieced will be owned by others. Your collections will have relationship with other collection, but you will not have direct access to those other collections. Some of these relationships are explicit. Some of them are implicit. If everybody were to expose their metadata then those explicit and implicit relationships can become more apparent. Once these relationships are strengthened and become more obvious, interest in the collections will increase accordingly, and the collections will be used to a greater degree. With this increased use will come increased attention, and in turn, a greater measure of success for the collections and services it provides.

Hi Jody,

If I understand correctly, you're keen to find examples of value generated.  I'll give this a whirl... and see if I'm being helpful.  

Converting data that already exists, >> providing a data service that a user community seeks to reuse and contribute to (access value).  

PeopleAustralia (National Library of Australia) provides permanent, resolvable unique identifiers that link to records about parties, i.e. people or organisations.  The authority file at the Library already had, was reused.  This data source was enhanced as a result of ANDS funding to identify parties that manage or own research data collections.  You'll see that this has increased the capacity for discovery (through collaboration with other data providers).  Key contact: Tim Sherratt @wragge  

Collaborating with custodians of primary material (collection managers), using third party data (Dbpedia), and finding, identifying and linking entities in the data >> brought to light information that was previously unknown (research value).

LinkedJazz at the Pratt Institute.  Finalist in the LODLAM 2013 summit award along with some other folks (for being generally super clever with LOD things).  Key contact: Cristina Patuelli @cristinapattuel 

Providing insights into the links in your own data >>  improve data quality (data value).   

Check out Chris McDowall's post on linking data in digitalNZ.  @fogonwater 

There are other kinds of value in all that.  Guess benefits depend on what the strategic goals of the organisation are, and what the research community needs in terms of access.    

Hope that helps?

Hi --
  I'm looking for selling points for utilizing linked data, for the institutions creating it. I would appreciate being pointed towards demos that show how particular tools can be utilized to provide improved access and use of local content for which linked data exists -- particularly with regards to primary source materials which have been digitized.
Without the "benefits" side of the equation, it's difficult to make a case for the "costs" part of the work, fascinating as it may be.
Suggestions?   Please feel free to contact me off list. 
Thanks!
