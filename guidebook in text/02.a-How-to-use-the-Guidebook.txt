02.a How to use the Guidebook

The structure of the Guidebook supports readers moving through the text in a variety of ways. Like a travel book, it provides useful high-level information for users who only need the basics, as well as in-depth information for those planning an extended stay in LOD-land. The Guidebook is intentionally named, and will draw from the genre of actual travel guides (Fodors, etc.) providing readers easy access to both high-level information (know before you go, what to see if you’re only there for a day) as well as in-depth details of for those staying in one place longer.

Synopses of the use cases developed by the LiAM project will be interspersed throughout the Guidebook to illustrate and frame the text. Each use case will be briefly described in 100-200 words with links to the full use cases on the LiAM website.

An initial release of the Guidebook will be in the form of a PDF document to be delivered to IMLS in fulfillment of the LiAM planning grant requirements as well as being shared with the public. However, the Guidebook’s ongoing vitality will benefit from a more dynamic publication environment, and we therefore plan to publish it in a wiki connected to a code repository. This combination will enable updating of the resource to reflect changes in the field as well as providing a mechanism for sharing tools, scripts, and other code related to the project.

Much of the rest of the Guidebook, while providing a concise overview of today’s linked data landscape and needs, would require ongoing updates, maintenance, and enhancement to describe implementation of LOD in the archival community over time.
