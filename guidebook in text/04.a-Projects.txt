4.a. Projects: Brief descriptions with an emphasis on tangible benefits and outcomes of each


Directories

  * Datahub (http://datahub.io/) - 
  * LODLAM (http://lodlam.net/) - "LODLAM is Linked Open Data in Libraries, Archives, and Museums.  LODLAM.net is an informal, borderless network of enthusiasts, technicians, professionals and any number of other people who are interested in or working with Linked Open Data pertaining to galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Linked refers to Linked Data, or the concept of connecting data using W3C standards.  Open refers to the use of open licenses, such as the Public Domain Mark, Creative Commons 0, Creative Commons Attribution, and Creative Commons Attribution-Alike. Data can be raw data, metadata, descriptive data, bibliographic data, etc. The LODLAM acronym was coined in the fall of 2010 by Jon Voss in attempt to begin gathering interest from like-minded individuals, largely in the United States (the acronym initially had a hyphen, LOD-LAM, but was removed as the community became active on Twitter).  Voss joined forces with Kris Carpenter Negulescu to organize the first global gathering that reached across the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).  Thanks to funding by the National Endowment of the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Internet Archive, more than 100 individuals from 17 countries and 85 organizations gathered in San Francisco in June of 2011 for the first International LODLAM Summit. LODLAM.net is designed to be a central place for sharing resources and connecting and collaborating with other interested individuals.  There is also a Google Group, and the #LODLAM hashtag is used extensively on Twitter for shared news, questions, and projects regarding LODLAM."

Projects

  * 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) - "I’ve (Neubert Joachim <J.Neubert@zbw.eu>) published the persons and company part of the 20th Century Press Archives (http://zbw.eu/beta/p20) as a linked data application. It uses RDFa and OAI-ORE extensively to give every dossier, every article and every page a citable URI, and on the other hand consumes linked data from various linked data sources to enrich the web pages and to provide context to the rather plain scanned article images. See http://challenge.semanticweb.org/submissions/swc2010_submission_6.pdf for more detail."
  * Linking Lives (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/linkinglives/) - Linking Lives is exploring ways to present Linked Data. We aim to show that archives can benefit from being presented as a part of the diverse data sources on the Web to create full biographical pictures, enabling researchers to make connections between people and events. Linking Lives builds upon the Locah project. Locah was a JISC-funded project to expose the Archives Hub descriptions as Linked Data.
  * LOCAH Project (http://archiveshub.ac.uk/locah/) - Mimas and UKOLN worked together on an exciting JISC funded project to make Archives Hub data available as structured Linked Data, for the benefit of education and research. We worked in partnership with Eduserv, Talis and OCLC, leading experts within their fields. The aim was put archival and bibliographic data at the heart of the Linked Data Web, enabling new links to be made between diverse content sources and enabling the free and flexible exploration of data so that researchers can make new connections between subjects, people, organisations and places to reveal more about our history and society.
  * OpenCat (http://demo.cubicweb.org/opencatfresnes/) - Another common theme / application demonstrated at the conference were variations of the venerable library catalog. OpenCat, presented by Agnes Simon (Bibliothéque Nationale de France), was an additional example of this trend. Combining authority data (available as RDF) provided by the National Library of France with works of a second library (Fresnes Public Library), the OpenCat prototype provides quite an interesting interface to library holdings.
  * ReLoad (http://labs.regesta.com/progettoReload/en) - an Italian experimentation started in 2012 and supported by Central State Archive, Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region and regesta.exe, published the first version of OAD ontology (ontology for archival description) based on ISAD (G) standard and EAD schema, in 2013. The project team define a specific ontology for archival description domain because there isn't yet something useful to describe all significant classes and properties necessary in archival description and we integrated OAD with other "Lightweight ontologies" (like foaf or dublin core) to encode the most common metadata. Within Reload project, to describe authority records in Linked Data we use EAC-CPF ontology, published in 2012 by Cultural Heritage Institute of Emilia Romagna Region. From the website: "The ReLoad project (Repository for Linked open archival data) will foster experimentation with the technology and methods of linked open data for archival resources. Its goal is the creation of a web of linked archival data."


Data sets

  * D2R Server for the Gutenberg Project (http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/gutendata/) - This is a data set of Project Gutenburgh content -- a list of digitized public domain works (books).
  
  * Getty Vocabularies (http://vocab.getty.edu) - A set of data sets generally used for visual materials description: subjects, names, etc.

  * Linked Open Data at Europeana (http://pro.europeana.eu/datasets) - "data.europeana.eu started as an experimental pilot  in February 2012 with a small number of data providers who committed at an early stage to Europeana's initiative of promoting more open data. The current version of the pilot contains metadata on 20 million texts, images, videos and sounds gathered by Europeana. They cover a great variety of heritage objects, such as this slovenian version of "O Sole Mio" from the National Library of Slovenia, or Neil Robson's memories of the herring business from the Tyne and Wear Archives & Museums."
